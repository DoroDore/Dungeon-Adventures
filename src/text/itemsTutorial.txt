Item in this game are divided into two main types: Weapons and General Item.
Each item has a given rarity. These include common, rare, epic, legendary, and sacred.
It is important to note, however, that these items do not become any more common as the game progresses. Instead, their drop rates will be set for the entire game.
On top of that, all items will have a "Latent Level" when obtained, which will not change. This essentially shows the power level of the weapon.
As you progress deeper into the dungeon, items that you find will have a higher and higher latent level.
That being said, storage is not unlimited in this game. This game's inventory takes the form of a bag with a set amount of space.
ll items have their own size, and will take up space in the inventory.
If the player encounters an item that exceeds the free space of their bag, they'll have to consume or dispose of items. Or, alternative, forgo that reward.
It is important to remember that inventory management is extremely important, as the difference of a single item could go a long way. [Press Enter/Return to Exit]
