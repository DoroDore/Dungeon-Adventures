This game uses a Prefixes Style Command system, which has been split into a variety of categories.
These commands work by having the user first input a keyword, followed by a command within that category in the structure [Prefix] [Command].
It is important to note that different phases have different prefix commands. These will be displayed at the start of every action.
During the Movement/GameMap Phase of the game, there are three main prefixes: Move, Look, and Item.
During Combat, there are three main prefixes: Attack, Skill, and Item. "Defend" is also an option that increases your defense.
During Events and Encounters however, you will simply be prompted to input a corresponding key to pick your choices.
To see what commands are available during any phase, simply input the universal "Help" prefix followed by the prefix you're uncertain about to find out more. [Press Enter/Return to Exit]
