The "Move" command is very simple, and it's main function is to allow you to traverse across the map.
The Move command follows the structure "Move [Direction]", where direction is either left, right, up, or down
Once a command is inputted, the player will be moved onto the tile, even if it is not revealed.
If it is any other tile other than an empty tile, represented by 'O', the respective event will commence.
Additionally, if you are obstructed, or unable to move to that tile for whatever reason, there will be an "Illegal Move Detected" message.
