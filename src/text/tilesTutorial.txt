Each dungeon is constructed with a series of different tiles, with each providing their own unique challenges and experiences.
In this game, there are six main tiles, each with their own different symbols:
O: Empty Tile   W: Wall   F: Fight   E: Event   L: Loot   X: Exit (Where the player is represented by the character 'A')
For Fight, Event, and Loot tiles, once each node is traveled to by the player, a random situation is picked from a set of different encounters for the player to face.
Once the tile is completed, it will become an empty tile.
That being said, if the player dies at any time within any of these events, they will lose their run.
Finally, if the Exit Tile (U) is reached, there will be a final confirmation, and the user may choose not to ascend to the next floor. [Press Enter/Return to Exit]
